## Tibber

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pfitzseb/atom-tibber.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pfitzseb/atom-tibber)

Small package that overloads the tab key with more functionality: You can now use
it to trigger autocomplete, accept an autocomplete result and also indent code.

Make sure to disable `Show Suggestions on Keystroke` in the autocomplete-plus settings
for the best possible user experience.

This isn't possible with custom keymap entries, which is why this package exists.
